How to read books on Kindle E-reader during night
</h3>
</header>
Hello Everybody,
<article>
<p>I wrote this post specifically for people who read e-books on basic Kindle E-Reader. It is not my intention to review this e-reader.



The only problem I had with my Kindle e-reader is I cannot read at night with lights off. This e-book reader is not backlit.

To fix this, you either have to</p>
<ol>
<li>Exchange with or buy a kindle paperwhite e-reader (Twice as expensive).</li>
<li>Turn on light in the room (Disturbs your roommate or partner).</li>
<li>Use your study lamp (Not easy to carry everywhere you go)</li>
<li>There will be always other ways, I have listed one in this post now and keep updating</li>
</ol>

<h4><p>How do I read books on Kindle in complete darkness:</h4><p>

I use a tiny gadget called "sidekick LED booklight" which clips to the device or a book, it is lightweight and can be carried in a pocket. It puts a lot of pressure on whatever it holds, so it is better to tack it using an appropriate adhesive.

Additional Information:

Why one cannot read Kindle in darkness.

The Kindle utilizes a different technology to other display systems such as LED, LCD etc. Under the screen, there are millions of tiny microcapsules each about the diameter of the thickness of a human hair and they also respond to the electric field. Kindle uses a two-color ink system (black and white). With the help of the electric field, the black and particles are manipulated to form different alphabets and images on the screen.

This technology is called "E Ink" now commercialized by E Ink Corporation.
